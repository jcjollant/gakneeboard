# GA Kneeboard - Product Context File

## Product Overview
GA Kneeboard (https://kneeboard.ga) is a web-based flight planning and kneeboard creation tool for General Aviation pilots. It allows pilots to create customized, printable kneeboards with all essential flight information organized and accessible during flight.

## Target Audience
- Student pilots (Private Pilot training)
- Private pilots (VFR flying)
- Instrument pilots (IFR flying)
- CFIs (Certified Flight Instructors)
- Active General Aviation pilots of all experience levels

## Core Value Proposition
GA Kneeboard transforms complex aviation information into simplified, visual formats that pilots can quickly reference during flight. Instead of juggling multiple apps, paper documents, and notes, pilots have everything organized on a single, printable kneeboard that clips to their leg or yoke.
