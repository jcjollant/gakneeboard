# Project Brief: GA Kneeboard

## Overview
GA Kneeboard is a web application designed for pilots to create, customize, and print digital kneeboard templates for flight planning and in-flight reference. The application provides a flexible system of tiles and pages that can be arranged to suit different flight scenarios, aircraft types, and pilot preferences.

## Core Requirements

### Template Management
- Create, save, load, and share kneeboard templates
- Support for multiple pages per template
- Template versioning and publication system

### Page Types
- Tiles Page: Customizable grid of information tiles
- Checklist Page: Structured checklists with multiple columns
- NavLog Page: Flight plan with waypoints, headings, altitudes, and timing
- Approach Page: Display approach plates and procedures
- Diagram Page: Airport diagrams
- Strips Page: Specialized strips for IFR flight note-keeping
- Notes Page: Free-form note taking
- Cover Page: Template cover with metadata

### Tile Types
- Airport: Display airport information, runways, frequencies
- ATIS/Weather: Weather information and reporting

- Pricing plans with different feature levels
- Print credits system

## Technical Goals
- Fast, responsive web application
- Reliable data storage and retrieval
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Offline functionality where possible
- Maintainable, modular code structure

## Success Criteria
- Pilots can create customized kneeboard templates that enhance their flight preparation and execution
- Templates can be easily shared between users
- The application is intuitive enough that new users can create useful templates quickly
