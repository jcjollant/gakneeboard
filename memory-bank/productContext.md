# Product Context: GA Kneeboard

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Pilots, especially in General Aviation (GA), need to organize and access critical information during flight. Traditional paper kneeboards are limited in customization and require manual updates. Digital solutions often lack flexibility or are too complex for practical use in a cockpit environment.

Key pain points for pilots include:
- Difficulty organizing diverse information (frequencies, airport data, checklists)
- Time-consuming manual creation of kneeboard pages
- Inability to quickly adapt templates for different flight scenarios
- Challenges in sharing standardized formats with other pilots
- Need for both digital planning and physical in-cockpit reference

### The Solution
GA Kneeboard bridges the gap between digital flight planning and physical in-cockpit reference by providing:
1. A flexible, modular system for organizing flight information
2. Customizable templates that can be saved, reused, and shared
3. Print-optimized output for use in physical kneeboards
4. Intuitive interface that requires minimal training
5. Specialized components for different aspects of flight planning

## Target Users

### Primary: Private Pilots
- Recreational flyers who own or rent aircraft
- Need simple, effective organization tools
- Value customization for personal preferences
- May fly both VFR and IFR

### Secondary: Flight Schools & Instructors
- Need standardized templates for student training
- Benefit from sharing consistent formats
- Use templates as teaching tools

### Tertiary: Commercial GA Pilots
- Charter pilots, corporate aviation
- Need more complex planning tools
- Value efficiency and standardization

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
- Users should be able to create useful templates within minutes
- Interface should be intuitive with minimal learning curve
- Common tasks should require minimal clicks

### Flexibility
- Support various flight types (VFR, IFR, training, cross-country)
- Accommodate different aircraft types and equipment
- Allow for personal organization preferences

### Reliability
- Templates should save reliably and be accessible across devices
- Printed output should be consistent and professional
- Critical information should be clearly presented

### Progression
- New users can start with demos and simple templates
- Advanced users can create complex, multi-page templates
- Sharing system allows community knowledge exchange

## How It Should Work

### Template Creation Flow
1. User selects a blank template or starts from a demo
2. User adds pages of different types (tiles, checklist, navlog, etc.)
3. User customizes each page with relevant information
4. Template is saved to user's account
5. User prints the template for physical use

### In-Flight Usage
1. Pilot references printed kneeboard pages during flight
2. Information is organized logically for quick reference
3. Critical information is emphasized visually
4. Multiple pages cover different phases of flight

### Template Sharing
1. Users can publish templates for community access
2. Templates can be discovered through the template library
3. Users can import and customize shared templates
4. Specialized templates (e.g., aircraft-specific checklists) are available

## Key Differentiators

### Modular Tile System
Unlike fixed-format solutions, GA Kneeboard's tile system allows pilots to arrange information exactly as they prefer.

### Print Optimization
While many solutions are purely digital, GA Kneeboard bridges digital planning with physical in-cockpit use.

### Aviation-Specific Components
Components are designed specifically for aviation use cases, with appropriate terminology and formats.

### Community Sharing
The ability to share templates creates a community knowledge base of best practices.

## Success Indicators

### User Engagement
- Regular template creation and updates
- Multiple templates per user for different scenarios
- Consistent printing activity

### Community Growth
- Increasing template sharing
- User-to-user recommendations
- Growth in specialized templates

### Practical Utility
- Templates that cover complete flight workflows
- Positive feedback on in-cockpit usability
- Time savings in flight preparation
