Welcome to NMS

NOTAM Management Service

Picture 7, Picture

 

 

 

 

 

We received your request to access the NMS-API interface and we are pleased to onboard you onto the new and modernized NOTAM Management Service (NMS). Below are the connection and credential details you will need to connect. Please note that this service uses OAUTH2 authentication.

 

Additional resources in case of issues or questions are provided below.

 

 

 

 

 

 

What to expect during this onboarding process

Please use the URL and credentials listed below to establish your connection. This will allow you to connect to a test environment and conduct your testing. If you experience any issues during your testing, please report them in an email to: CGI.NMS.Interface.Support@cgifederal.com.

 

Once you completed your validation in the test environment, please contact the NOTAM Service Center by email 7-AWA-NAIMES@faa.gov or call 866-466-1336 to request next steps for onboarding to Production.

  title: NOTAM Management System API (NMS-API)
  version: '1.0.17 - Revised: 2025-10-24'
  description: |-
    **Overview**

    The NMS-API provides endpoints for requesting NOTAM data. Optional filters
    are provided to request subsets of NOTAM data. Supported filters are:
    accountability, classification, effect start and end date, feature, free 
    text, id, last updated date, latitude, location, longitude, NOTAM number, 
    and radius.

    The API also supports requesting initial load data by NOTAM 
    classification.

    The API also support requesting NOTAM checklists data. Checklist data is 
    filtered by: accountability, classification, and location.

    Additionally, the API provides access to Location-Series data.

    **Authentication**

    Access to the API endpoints is restricted by bearer token authentication. 
    The bearer token is renewed using the *client_id*, *client_secret*, 
    and *authorization URL* provided during API registration. To renew the 
    token a POST request must be sent to the *authorization URL*.
    ---
    ***Example:***
    ```
    curl -X POST \
    --location "https://<HOST_NAME>/v1/auth/token" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d grant_type=client_credentials \
    -u <CLIENT_ID>:<CLIENT_SECRET>
    ```

    **Data Formats**

    NMS-API responses are JSON formatted messages. NOTAM data within the 
    response body will be represented as either AIXM 5.1 or GeoJSON format, 
    depending on the user provided *nmsResponseFormat* HTTP header. The 
    *nmsResponseFormat* header is a required parameter, if it is not provided 
    an error will be generated. Acceptable header values are:

    *nmsResponseFormat: AIXM | GEOJSON*
